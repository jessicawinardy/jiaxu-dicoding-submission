            <h1>&#10067; Who is Xavier?</h1>
            <p>
              Xavier is a tall young man with grey-blonde hair, blue eyes, and
              fair skin. He is typically seen wearing a white sweater and dark
              pants. Despite his youthful physique, his real age is unknown.

            <p>
              Recently, many citizens have been talking about a mysterious
              hunter who rescued them from Wanderers. With his combat prowess,
              he took down very dangerous Wanderers and disappeared in the blink
              of an eye, as if pursuing something greater. We reached out to the
              witnesses. From their accounts, it seems their mysterious savior
              is Xavier, a Deepspace Hunter.

                He sometimes gets injured in missions, but barely ever visits
                the hospital to get his wounds treated. Alarm Clock, Fatso... He
                names every bird that frequently visits his house. He loves to
                fish and ended up befriending the uncle who runs the guesthouse
                because of this.

                I didn't think he's read a book like Claw Machines: From
                Beginner to Master. When he was in school, he'd get perfect
                scores on the exam about his favorite subjects. As for
                everything else... who knows. That hidden cavern seems to be
                related to his past...

                No meat, no happiness. He has to eat it. He's the old-school
                type who still uses physical keys.

                He started practicing swordsmanship when he was little. And he
                even had a training partner. Trapped in a mysterious hall
                located in a no-hunt zone with Xavier... It seems that I've been
                there before. All the Protocores got blown up just like that...
                Is he really a newbie like me? Xavier turns out to be my
                upstairs neighbor
